# Hardware

The BirdWeather FAQ and Forums has plenty of information on the additional hardware needed to create a remote listening location. We have compiled some of that information here.

## PUC vs Raspberry Pi

### PUC

The PUC is a portable audio recording device created by BirdWeather. The device is also capable of reporting its GPS coordinates, gyroscopic information, and environmental data (air quality, light).

We designed this app using the BirdWeather API.

The PUC can be purchased on the [Birdweather website](https://www.birdweather.com/) for $249.

### Raspberry Pi

A similar setup could be made using a Raspberry Pi running BirdNet-Pi.

## Power

The PUC takes AA batteries. However, it will not be able to operate for more than a day on battery power alone.

The cheapest, most straight-forward option to continuously power the PUC is to plug it in via the USB-C port. If the power cable and/or PUC will be exposed to the elements, a weather-resistent power cable with a rubber seal on the connector should be used. BirdWeather's FAQ recommends the [Ring Indoor/Outdoor Power Adapter](https://a.co/d/3Smtuv1).

### Solar Power

If you're setting up the PUC in a remote location, you'll likely need to set up a solar panel. 

## Internet

The PUC must be connected to Wi-Fi in order for the exhibit to show a realtime feed of bird detections. For setup near buildings or some established research stations, this may not be an issue. This option is likely the cheapest and easiest, but you may be restricted to more human-populated areas. This will influence the number and types of birds your station will encounter, as many species do not occur in urban areas. If your exhibit is highlighting urban wildlife, perhaps this is fine!

### Mobile Hotspot
A live feed can be made possible in more remote areas that still have cellular service by using a mobile hotspot.

How much data does the PUC use?
This will heavily depend on 

### No Cellular Service?
A live feed is still possible in some locations that lack ceullar service, but the monthly costs will be more expensive.

Starlink's roaming plan starts at $50/mo for 50GB. This may not be enough data for a recording station that runs 24/7 at a site with high bird activity, but it may be fine for other sites. I have not heard of anyone attempting
