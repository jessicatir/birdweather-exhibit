Birdweather Exhibit is a Flutter app used to display a live feed of the bird species calling in another location. This is intended to be used as a showcase of local bird diversity and AI species detection technology for visitors to a museum or other public education space.

This app is designed to work with the BirdWeather PUC recording system and BirdWeather API. 

For information on the hardware needed to set up a live feed, see [Hardware](https://github.com/jessicatir/birdweather-exhibit/blob/main/hardware.md#hardware).

For information on installing and using the app, see Installation Guide.
